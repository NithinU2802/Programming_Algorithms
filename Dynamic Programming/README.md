# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH 
 
           Dynamic programming approach refers to a problem which can computed with major or different
    implementations that can be solved by this technique...!

        # This Approach helps to retrieve multiple solutions from the problem 

           This method breaks the problem into subproblem and saves result for future purpose...!

        -> No need to compute the result again.
        -> Uses sub problems to optimize the result.

        Equation:  F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) 

        # Easiest Example to implement which is fibonacci Series
