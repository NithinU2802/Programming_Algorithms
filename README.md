# Programming Algorithms and its implementations
 
              The main motto of this repository is to learn the basic algorithm used in programming and that 
    be used to implement problems which make easier to understand the situation and make use of algorithm most
    effectively lets get into it...!

        An program is an tool that can be used to implement various task. Normally a programming is differ from
    that we learn towards the side of alogrithm lets learns these algorithms. Some basic algorithm used in 
    programming to implement the concept are
     
                    1. Sort algorithms
                    2. Search algorithms
                    3. Hashing
                    4. Dynamic Programming
                    5. Exponential by squaring
                    6. String matching and parsing
                    7. Primality testing algorithms

        Now we learn one by one and make some task over it learn the working of these algorithms lets build the 
    basics of seven algorithms....!
